# **Automated Email Warmup Platform**

## **Overview**

The **Automated Email Warmup Platform** is a sophisticated solution built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) designed to enhance email deliverability and boost sender reputation while protecting emails from being flagged as spam. The platform automates the email warmup process, helping to gradually increase a low sender reputation score to a stronger one, ensuring optimal inbox placement and engagement rates.

## **Key Features**

- **Seamless Email Integration**: Easily integrates with multiple email services (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) to automate the email warmup process.
- **Adaptive Warmup Scheduling**: Customize the warmup schedule with flexible time intervals and email frequency.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track the health of email accounts with real-time status updates.
- **Automated Random Replies**: Simulates natural email activity by sending and receiving random replies to mimic real user behavior, helping to build a solid sender reputation.
- **Spam Protection**: Ensures that your emails are not flagged as spam, enhancing deliverability.
- **Customizable Dashboard**: View performance data and email health status at a glance with detailed reporting on email deliverability and sender reputation.
